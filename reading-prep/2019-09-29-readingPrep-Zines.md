# Reading Prep: Zines

#### Alice Schaumann

## Questions or Observations

1. How might the impact of Pagan Kennedy's zine be different when read in her book as compared to its original format?
2. Wortham discusses the importance of zines being separate from the internet. Do digital zines like THRESHOLDS then have less value, or lose some of the vulnerability of traditional zines? Would Wortham still consider them to be zines?
3. What do erasure poets owe to the original text?
