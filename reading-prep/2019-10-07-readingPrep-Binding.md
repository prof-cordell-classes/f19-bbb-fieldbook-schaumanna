## Questions or Observations

1. Dantas emphasizes the importance of content in guiding the form of the book, while Driscoll and Squires discuss the way the manner of use of marine guides informs their form. When should form follow function, and when should it follow content?
2. For Schmittle, the content of her work will be guided by the materias she chooses to incorporate, while for Dantas the materials were guided by the content. What impact does this have on the work and how does it impact the reader's experience?
3. In the Driscoll and Squires reading, the authors note the shock they felt at damaging a book. They attribute their reaction to their "aspirational middle-class" upbringing, and assert that comfort with damaging a book requires “confidence born from the possession of significant cultural capital.” I don’t know that it’s true that a person with that kind of cultural capital would feel comfortable harming a book. I think people with substantial cultural capital are often keen on keeping it, and a book can be a symbol of cultural status. The high-powered “gentlemen of culture” in Chesnutt’s Bodleian Club wouldn’t even open the packaging of Baxter’s Procrustes because of its perceived value (cultural and monetary).
