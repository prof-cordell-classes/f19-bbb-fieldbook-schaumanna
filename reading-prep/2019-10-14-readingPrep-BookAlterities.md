# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

#### Alice Schaumann

## Questions or Observations

1. BÃ¶k's Xenotect and Patterson's future book library bring into question the longevity of books. Is it possible to make a book that will last forever? Is it desirable?
2. The changes Mod discusses that have allowed book publishing to become more widely accessible remind me of the changes in early books (especially those brought about by the invention of the printing press) that allowed access to reading books to expand to the masses. What is the next frontier for book accessibility?
3. When making altered books, what consideration, if any, should be given to the book's original content or intent?
