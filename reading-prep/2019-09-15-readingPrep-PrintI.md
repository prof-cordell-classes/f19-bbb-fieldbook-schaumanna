## Questions or Observations

1. The articles presented somewhat differing explanations for the recent rise of letterpress printing. The "Design Guide" credits letterpress's "uniqueness" and "vintage effect," while A.C. and Fleishman focus more on technological advancements like lasers and 3D printing. What do you think is the biggest contributing factor? Why accounts for the disagreement/uncertainty about the cause of letterpress's rise?
2. A.C. and Fleishman both assert that digital printing advancements in teh 1980s and 90s "doomed" letterpress printing. In our other readings and class discussions we have noted that old technologies tend to remain in practice for a while after the introduction of new technologies. Are we seeing a revival of letterpress, or has it simply not been fully supplanted yet?
3. Lynch discusses several ways in which design and function work together in letterpress printing (e.g. dingbats embellish extra space, while also helping to print more evenly). Some of that interplay seems to be lost in some modern letterpress trends. Debossing, for example, wears type out much more quickly. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that the "letterpress revival" seems to be driven more by form than function. People like the tactility and "vintage effect" of letterpress, even though the process is more difficult and time consuming than digital printingâ€”it seems to be more of an aesthetic choice that can come at the expense of efficiency.
