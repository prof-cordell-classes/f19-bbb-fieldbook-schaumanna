# Reading Prep: Fabrication I: 3D Printing

#### Alice Schaumann

## Questions or Observations

1. How do we benefit from forgery (with deceptive intent) and how does it harm us?
2. When exploring history through replications of artifacts, is there a danger that we disregard the context of the original?
3. This week's readings emphasized the growing accessibility of 3D printing equipment and knowledge, but there are still significant barriers to entryâ€”many makerspaces require membership to certain institutions for access and while costs for individuals to purchase their own equipment have decreased, they are still higher than many people can afford. How do we ensure we are cognizant of these issues and inclusive of underrepresented groups?
