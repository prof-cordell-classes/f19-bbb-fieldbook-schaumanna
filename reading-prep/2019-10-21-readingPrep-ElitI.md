# Reading Prep: E-lit

#### Alice Schaumann

## Questions or Observations

1. Jabr and La Farge both discuss the "potential" of e-lit. What exactly is this potential and how can it be realized?
2. I found Jabr's discussion of text as a physical landscape to be particularly interesting. E-lit may not have the same dimensions and physicality as a print book, but might its other affordances allow it to develop a physical landscape in a different way?
3. How do we determine the best way to readâ€”does it have more to do with what we seek to get out of the text (La Farge's comprehension vs. pleasure) or the format of the book (Jabr's plain text vs. multimedia and screen-based experiences)?
