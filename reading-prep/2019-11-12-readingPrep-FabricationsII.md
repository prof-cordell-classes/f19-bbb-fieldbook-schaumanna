# Reading Prep: Fabrication II

## Questions or Observations

1. The “Bibliocircuitry” reading discusses the value of alterity relations with technology, where technology is not a black box, but something to be looked at, engaged with, and altered. The reading emphasizes the implications of this for innovation and engagement, but are there other dangers of hiding the mechanisms of our technologies?

2. To read Holl-Jensen’s “The Hollow” requires cutting it open, thereby losing some of the book’s integrity and its meaning when uncut. This is reminiscent of other artists’ books that must be destroyed to be read, like the book we looked at in the archives whose pages must be torn out to see what is next. It also reminds me of Baxter’s _Procrustes_, where the value of the book was compromised by opening it.

3. The ivory busts that the University of Toronto lab members are trying to reproduce are themselves reproductions, much like the Lincoln mask we read about last week. I think this is indicative of a value that we seem to recognize in replicas but don’t often acknowledge.
