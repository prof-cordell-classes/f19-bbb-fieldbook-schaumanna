# Reading Prep: E-lit II

#### Alice Schaumann

## Questions or Observations

1. Flores differentiates between the way we would think of “Lazy Cat” in terms of second generation work and in terms of third generation work. How does the context in which we consider a work influence our judgment of it? What value can a work have independent of its context?
2. To me, poetry seems particularly tied to authorial intent. Can computer-generated poetry be as meaningful as poetry written by person?
3. The team that recreated bpNichol’s “First Screenings” noted that e-lit can “survive the obsolescence of technologies” if “the artist has provided what is required to implement the work using later technologies.” What does an e-lit creator need to do to ensure their work’s longevity?
