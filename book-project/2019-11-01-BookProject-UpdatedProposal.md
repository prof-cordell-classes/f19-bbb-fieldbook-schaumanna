# Book Project Proposal - Updates

#### Alice Schaumann 

## Content and Format

For my book project, I want to explore the concept of the pageâ€”what it means as a unit of a book, how its layout influences interaction with the text, what its materials mean for how it is perceived, etc. According to Bonnie Mak, "The page is an expressive space for text, space, and image; it is a cultural artefact; it is a technological device." I want to use my book book project to explore all of these roles of the page in depth. I will use a series of Hans Christian Andersen short stories for the content of my project. I will create a separate book for each story and use each of these books to explore the page in a different way. 

####I. The Leaping Match

The first story I will use is "The Leaping Match," which I will format as a picture book. Here I will examine the way picture books make use of the page as a discrete, meaningful unit, with the content of each focused on something represented by a picture on that page. This will also provide an arena to explore the page as "expressive space for text, space, and image," as all are present in a picture book, as well as as "a cultural artefact," as the way content is presented (large text, lots of space, pictures) indicates the type of reader a picture book is for.

####II. The Old House

I will use "The Old House" as a "fancy" book, with heavier paper for the pages and wide margins (indulgent use of space), to demonstrate how the page can be used to convey social status. This will focus on the book as "a cultural artefact."

####III. The Snow Queen

"The Snow Queen" will serve as a juxtaposition to "The Old House," with small, cramped type and advertisements between some pages to indicate cheapness.

####IV. The Loving Pair

"The Loving Pair" will be created in the style of a zine, drawing on the multimedia affordances of the form. Like the picture book, this will treat the page as a discrete meaningful unit.

####V. The Steadfast Tin Soldier

Finally, "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" will be organized like a textbook, with headings, diagrams, and wide margins. This will focus on the way the page can be used as "a technological device" to convey information.
