# Book Project Proposal

## Content and Format

For my book project, I want to explore the concept of the page—what it means as a unit of a book, how its layout influences interaction with the text, what its materials mean for how it is perceived, etc. According to Bonnie Mak, "The page is an expressive space for text, space, and image; it is a cultural artefact; it is a technological device." I want to use my book book project to explore all of these roles of the page in depth. I would like to use Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's _A Study In Scarlet_ for the content of my project. _A Study In Scarlet_ is made up of two parts with seven chapters each. I would like to create a separate book for each chapter and use each of these books to explore the page in a different way. In Part I, I want to explore the form and material of the page. In Part II, I want to explore the content and its layout. My plan for each chapter is as follows:

Part I

- Chapter 1: traditional format
    - Serve as a sort of control
- Chapter 2: traditional format, heavily used
    - From used copy of the book that has been well-loved by the reader
    - Ideally highlighting, notes, dog-eared pages
    - Demonstrate how a reader may engage with traditional format
- Chapter 3: content divided into coherent sections, pages sized to fit sections
    - Explore what book looks like if page is considered most meaningful unit
- Chapter 4: "fancy" pages
    - Emphasize how page can convey social status
    - Heavier paper or cardstock
    - Perhaps some other "status symbols"—historiated initials, marbling, etc.
- Chapter 5: scroll
    - Not the traditional horizontal scroll—vertical, like scrolling through website
    - No pages, paragraphs are only breaks in text
- Chapter 6: accordion scroll
    - Pages not separated from each other, but still have visual breaks
    - Can be read with section open, or all folded up in accordion
- Chapter 7: pages made of different materials
    - Impact of material of page on how reader interacts with text

Part II

- Chapter 1: space provided for notes
    - Extra margins and line spacing for reader to interact with the text
- Chapter 2: content organized like a textbook
    - Information organized to ease reader's understanding
    - Headings, diagrams, etc.
- Chapter 3: picture book
    - Each page focused on something represented by a picture on that page
- Chapter 4: marginal references to outside information
    - Use the margins of the book to connect the content to outside sources discussing the book and/or issues it touches upon
- Chapter 5: typographical variation
    - Explore effect of different typefaces
- Chapter 6: TBD
    - Something informed by what I notice about the way the used copy has been marked up
- Chapter 7: zine
    - Multimedia
    - Dramatic changes in page layout as move from one idea to another

## Skills

I plan on printing and binding all of these whose formats allow. I will therefore need to learn how to bind books, which I believe will be covered in class next week. I feel comfortable with the page formatting skills that this project will require. Some of the chapters (the picture book in particular) will require artistic abilities I do not possess. I will either try my best and aim for something less realistic or use some outside source for illustrations.

## Evaluation

My goal for this book is to explore the meaning of the page and how that meaning is informed by its overall form and by the way content is presented within it. In the finished product, each chapter should provide the reader with a different experience based on the forms and layouts of the pages. Ideally, the book will also highlight for the reader different aspects of the page that normally go unnoticed.

Perhaps an appropriate way to evaluate whether this goal has been met would be through some sort of peer review. It would probably be unreasonable to ask a peer to read the book in full, but I could have them peruse the different chapters and then discuss their impressions. I will have been successful if at they come away from the book thinking critically about the page and its influence on their reading experience.
